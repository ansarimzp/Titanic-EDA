# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and visualize relationships within the data to better understand the factors affecting passenger survival.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Files Used**: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the data
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Identify key patterns and anomalies
- Summarize findings in a structured report

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, dropped unnecessary columns, and converted categorical variables.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Explored individual features using histograms and value counts.
3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**: Used bar plots, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots to examine relationships between features and the target variable (`Survived`).
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations to identify influential factors.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features like `FamilySize` to enhance analysis.
6. **Visualization**: Applied Seaborn and Matplotlib for clear, informative plots.
7. **Summary**: Compiled key insights and statistical findings into a PDF report.

## Results & Insights

- **Gender and Class**: Women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.
- **Fare and Age**: Higher fares and younger ages were associated with increased survival chances.
- **Embarkation Port**: Passengers from Cherbourg had a higher survival rate.
- **Family Size**: Passengers with small families were more likely to survive compared to those alone or with large families.
